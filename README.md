# r-project
A project for demoing the R language for partial completion of IT 327 at Illinois State University.

## Setup

### R Language
You can download the R language from [here](https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/) or any of these other [mirrors](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).

### IDE
I recommend installing the free version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to use as an IDE.

### Packages
Currently, this project is using some packages that need to be installed. You can run the below lines within the console of RStudio to install them. 

```R
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("zoo")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
